# new-computer-setup

I have not verified that VSCode and Homebrew installation work as intended, but I have verified that the script will continue running if you have the files already. I would like to refine this script the next time I need to set up a new computer. However, the rest of the script should work as intended.

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=osx)
